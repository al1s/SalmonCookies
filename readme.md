# Salmon Cookies wholesale store

## Day 1

### User Stories (MVP)

As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business

As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information

As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

### Technical Requirements

New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine

Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history

Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names

Main page meets requirements of the problem domain

Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)

As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business

## Day 2

### User Stories (MVP)

As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript

As a user, I want cookie sales data represented in tables rather than lists

### Technical Requirements

Good use of a constructor function; style and syntax are correctly implemented

Each cookie stand location should have a separate render() method that creates and appends its row to the table

The header row and footer row are each created in their own stand-alone function

Duplicate code has been removed and DRY principles are evident

Working on a non-master branch for the day, with regular commit history. Basically, every time you get something to work, you should do a commit. But you only need to push every couple of hours or so, tops.

### User Stories (Stretch... NOT REQUIRED)

As a developer, I will continue to work on design aspects of the public-facing page.

As a developer, to facilitate design work, I will build a style guide.

As a developer, to demonstrate to my client my ability to add value, I will create a second table that will help Pat manage staffing. Using the basic rubric that single Salmon Cookie Tosser can serve 20 customers per hour, and that each location should have a minimum of two Salmon Cookie Tossers on shift at all times, calculate how many Salmon Cookie Tossers are needed at each location each hour.
